# CAN Spy

A practical hardware device and software tool for wirelessly monitoring and exploiting Controller Area Network (CAN) systems. Strictly for educational and security research purposes. This project was developed as the course project for UCLA ECE 202A Embedded Systems taken Fall 2024 with professor Mani Srivastava.

# Abstract

The CAN protocol is ubiquitously used in automotive and vehicular technology, however, it was not developed with modern security practices in mind and thus is vulnerable to a whole host of attacks. The goal of this project is to put these attacks into practice by building a device which can wirelessly stream CAN BUS traffic to a third party for reconnaissance and receive commands to perform established and custom attacks alike.

This project aims to be a powerful tool for security researchers by enabling them to reverse engineering and prototype CAN exploits.
